Expands **Common UI** to allow for swift creation of button groups using **List View**. Logic is kept in a separate object, promoting reusability and enabling division of work among team members. **It might not be the best way to manage buttons out there, but this is what I came up with.** It is not painless, just a *different kind of pain*.

The plugin comes packed with a titular **L_ExampleMap** example map. Contained in the **Example** folder. Together with a couple things to set everything up. You can safely delete the **Example** folder altogether once you understand how 3 functions in 2 objects work.

### Why not use Common UIâ€™s Button Groups?

Use whatever works best for you.
